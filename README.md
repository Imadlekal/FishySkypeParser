# FishySkypeParser
<br>Skype log parser in C# with WPF
<br>===============================
<br>Skype allows download of the chat logs and also a parser, but the official parser could be better.
<br>This one has:
<br>* colors for me + extra 3 users (easy to increase)
<br>* my messages on the left side and others' messages on the right side
<br>* search
<br>* filter for a timeframe
<br>
<br>ToDo:
<br>=====
<br>* a nicer UI with maybed rounded balloons
<br>* user should be able to select between faster load/display and smooth scroll
<br>
<br>Liability:
<br>=========
<br>I am not responsible for any loses. The code is there, look into it, run it or not.
<br>Obviously the application needs more testing and probably updates. Keep in mind that it's free and young (i.e. may have bugs).
<br>
<br>Executable:
<br>===============
<br>You should not trust me blindly and just run it, you should clearly build it yourself (Visual Studio 2017/.NET 4.5)
<br>However, the exe is available, archived in the Binaries folder.
